// Question 1

// Anytime you want to print to the putty terminal
// printf("This is what i print")
// works like any other print statement
// You can make things coloured buy doing
// printf("%s This is my name %s Taylor", KRED, KNRM)
// Prints "This is my name in red"
// Printf "Taylor in the default colour"
// Always switch back to the default at the end of the print, otherwise it will stay the last colour

// Frame from lib.c
// "add" &add_function "Help description"
// Functions needed
// - debug
// - cd "Name of directory " (current directory) eg cd documents, changes the current directory to the documents folder
//      					 this only works for folders inside the current folder
//							 also works for paths inside the folder eg. documents/uni_work/elec3240
// - cd (without folder name) this goes back to the root folder
// - cd .. (moves back 1 folder)

// - ls (list items in folder) lists the items in the current folder
// - ls "Name of directory" lists the files in that directory/path

// - mkdri "Name" (makes folder in current folder called "Name")

// cp "file1" "file2" (copies file1 into a new file2) if the file already exists just overwrite  it
// 					  file1 could be the path to a file eg documents/myfile.txt

// rm "file" (delete file)

// Debug
// Debug messages as before, will need most of Debug.c and Debug.h

// Analog "time" send me a message that will change a value for me, just make the function and ill woryy about the message

// There's more you can do if you get this done easily
